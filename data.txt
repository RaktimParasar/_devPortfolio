<!--I describe myself as a passionate developer who is
          specifically engaged in the development of web applications on the
          client-side of the web. My workflow includes building out the visual
          components of a website from designs and making it interactive and
          convenient.</br> 
          Aside from coding, I like to create content on Instagram
          about documenting my learning process from the challenges that I take
          part in several coding challenge websites. Also, I write about the
          experience with different technologies used on my side-projects.</br>
          In my
          free time, I started to make a habit of reading a book or playing
          mobile games, and binge-watching my favorite Tv shows. -->
